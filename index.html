            <h2>A new report shows</h2>
            <p>
                In the rapidly warming Antarctic, two species of penguins are in dramatic
                decline.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s the news out of a new study published by Oceanites, a nonprofit 
                organization that closely monitors penguins and other <span style="color:red">Antarctic seabirds</span> , in <br>
                collaboration with researchers from NASA and Stony Brook University in 
            </p>
            <p>
                Relying on satellite photos and on-the-ground analysis from more than 660
                sites across the frozen continent, the study paints a broad picture of the health
                of several Antarctic penguin species: the Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, and
                gentoo. Like endangered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear">polar bears</a>, penguins have come to represent
                vulnerability in the face of rapidly unfolding <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/climate-change" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">climate change</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The report looked specifically at the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed by
                a year-round average of 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 60 years. <br>
                There, two species — Adélie and chinstrap penguins — were reported to be in
                severe decline. Meanwhile, gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to
                changing circumstances.
